# FRC 2023

[![Build](https://github.com/SummitRobotics/FRC2023/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/SummitRobotics/FRC2023/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Team 5468's 2023 FRC robot code. This code is written in Java and is based off of WPILib's Java control system and utilizes a command based system.

The code is divided into several packages, each responsible for a different aspect of the robot function. This README explains setup instructions, the function of each package, and some of the variable naming conventions used. Additional information about each specific class can be found in that class' Java file.

## Setup Instructions

### General
1. Clone this repository
1. Run `./gradlew` to download gradle and needed FRC/Vendor libraries
1. Run `./gradlew tasks` to see available options
1. Enjoy!

### Visual Studio Code (Official IDE)
1. Get the WPILib extension for easiest use from the VSCode Marketplace - Requires Java 11 or greater

* Run `./gradlew build` to build the code.  Use the `--info` flag for more details
* Run `./gradlew test` to run all of the JUnit tests

## Conventions

### Variable Naming Conventions
- CONSTANT_VARIABLE - Constant variables are all caps with underscores seperating names.
- normalVariable - Most everything else uses cammelCase.
- ClassName - All classes use Title Case per normal java convention.

### Branch Naming Conventions
- a_branch_name - Generic branches. Mainly feature branches
- clean_##### or clean_NAME - A branch for cleaning up code
- dev_##### or dev_NAME - A branch for rapid development (Ex. At comps)
- fix_##### or fix_NAME - A branch for making thoughout fixes
- hotfix_##### or hotfix_NAME - A branch for hotfixes
- \#\#\#\#\# - Number in the format MonthDayIncrement (Ex. for the second cleanup branch on Jan 20 (clean_01202))
